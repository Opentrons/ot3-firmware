#[=======================================================================[.rst:
ClangTidy
---------

This is a CMake module providing macros and functions to handle calling
ClangTidy on our cross-compiled sources, which is a little involved.

Usage
+++++

To use this module, make sure you're setting the cmake module path to this
directory and call
```
include(ClangTidy)
```

Then, you can use the macros defined in here.


Provided Macros
++++++++++++++++

add_clang_tidy_target(
  TARGET targetname
  LINT_SOURCES sources...
  [NO_ADD_TO_LINT_TARGET]
  )

This macro creates a custom target that calls clang-tidy. LINT_SOURCES should be a list of source
files that should be linted; it should not include files that shouldn't be checked, which is
generally C files and files that are entirely HAL calls that clang-tidy hates.

The macro will also add the target to LINT_TARGETS which is assumed to exist in parent scope, unless
NO_ADD_TO_LINT_TARGETS is set.

  # An odd thing about this target is that it requires the existance of a compiledb, which
  # is produced when you build, and may change if you change compilation options, so in a way
  # it depends on a build. But we also want to be able to run this when there wasn't a successful
  # build, so there's no explicit dependency set.
  # This awful transform is required because the implicit includes that gcc knows how to find (e.g. its
  # own implementation of the STL) don't get added to the compile db that clang-tidy uses to figure out
  # include directories. So we can use the actually fairly cool transform command to turn them all into
  # extra-arg invocations and it'll figure it out.
